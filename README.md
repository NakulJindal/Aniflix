# Aniflix

This is a anime streaming website created using React and Recoil for state management (Frontend), mongoDB, express.js and node.js (Backend). People can watch trailers of all the animes, see the upcoming animes and schedule of current week for latest episode. Signed up users can add there favourate anime to there watchlist and track them seperately. I used Jikan API in this project.
